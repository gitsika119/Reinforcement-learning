# Project 4 - RL Based Cartpole Project 

Congrats! This is the LAST project you will have to complete to get the Nittany AI Advanced MLB certification! If you've made it this far, we truly appreciate you sticking around
for all of the projects and hoped you've been able to learn just how effective ML can be. Your progress to this point shows your determination, tenacity, and commitment. 

Please refer to this file and the template if you have any questions for this final project.

## Project Description

In this project, you will be implementing a "cartpole" using Reinforcement Learning. The goal is for you to learn a little bit more about Reinforcement Learning and it's use cases in the real world. 
This project is not meant to be as intensive as the past ones, but rather a friendly intro into the power of RL! 

## Submission Criteria 

As you have done for the first and second projecs, please submit the project via GitHub. Much like for the previous ones, please instead submit to the assignment on google classroom with your GitHub username and commit ID. As far as grading criteria goes, we will test out your cartpole project to see how well it does at balancing! 

**This project will be due April 30th!** 

## Tips and last remarks 

- Please use the template, it has a lot of helpful resources for you!
- As always, have fun while learning along the way and reach out with any questions :)
