# RL Based Cartpole 
## Summary
In this project, we implement the classic CartPole problem using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The objective is to train an agent to balance a pole on a moving cart by learning optimal actions through trial and error. This approach serves as an introduction to RL concepts and demonstrates their real-world applications.
